# StenzelBeast
The Cyborg Beast was having trouble rendering in the handomatic assembler, so I though I would try to make an OpenSCAD version of it. This is the result. I have also added the ability to add and remove the fingers. I have not printed a hand yet and this is my first design of a hand part.
